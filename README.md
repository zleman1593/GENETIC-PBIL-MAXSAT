# GENETIC-PBIL-MAXSAT

A Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Population-based Incremental Learning (PBIL)  Algorithm have been implemented in separate classes. These have been written to solve MAXSAT problems read in from CNF files.  The Controller class can take command line arguments to solve a given MAXSAT problem with either algorithm with various parameters. The TestContoller can be used for more comprehensive testing of the algorithms where test cases can be written and stats will be reported.
